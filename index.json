Terence investigates proself versus prosocial motives for sharing gossip, how receivers of gossip react to gossip in terms of cooperation with gossipers and targets of gossip, and how receivers attribute motives to gossipers which can shape their reaction to gossip.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://terencedorescruz.com/authors/admin/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/admin/","section":"authors","summary":"Terence D.
