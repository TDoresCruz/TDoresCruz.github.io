Although gossip research has recently increased across the social sciences, gossip is conceptualized in disparate ways in the scientific literature. This conceptual confusion impedes theoretical integration and providing practical advice. To resolve this, we systematically reviewed 6114 scientific articles on gossip and identified 324 articles that define gossip. From these definitions, we extracted two essential characteristics of gossip on which there seems to be agreement within the literature, namely, (1) that gossip is communication between humans involving a sender, a receiver, and a target, and (2) that the target is absent or unaware of the communicated content. These two characteristics formed the basis of a broad, integrative definition of gossip: a sender communicating to a receiver about a target who is absent or unaware of the content. Furthermore, some definitions include characteristics on which there is less agreement: gossip valence (from negative to neutral to positive) and formality (from informal to intermediate to formal). We incorporate these characteristics in a dimensional scaling framework that can guide future research. Our broad, integrative definition of gossip and the dimensional scaling framework provide the building blocks for a systematic, integrated knowledge base on the role of gossip in human social life in general as well as in organizations. This can foster future theory development and hypothesis testing, ultimately helping organizations to manage gossip.","tags":[],"title":"Defining and Studying (Organizational) Gossip","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Rens de Jong - BNR Nieuwsradio"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1665446400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1665446400,"objectID":"b1e98b99e19da5e84c817a6f1c604026","permalink":"https://terencedorescruz.com/post/bnr-werkverkenners/","publishdate":"2022-10-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/bnr-werkverkenners/","section":"post","summary":"In this interview, featured on Dutch radio BNR and the Werkverkenners podcast, I talk about the positive and negative sides of gossip.","tags":null,"title":"Werkverkenners: Roddelen op het werk","type":"post"},{"authors":["NOS Nieuws"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1663286400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1663286400,"objectID":"cb237c7fa0221c57112876d7472ea087","permalink":"https://terencedorescruz.com/post/nos-ig-nobel/","publishdate":"2022-09-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/nos-ig-nobel/","section":"post","summary":"Item about our research team receiving the Ig Nobel Peace Prize.

This presents a conundrum: if there are social costs to sharing gossip, then individuals will be better off if staying silent and free-riding on the gossip shared by others. Yet, if everyone stays silent, the reputation system will no longer be useful and will break down, inhibiting reputation-based cooperation. This suggests that gossip may be a second-order social dilemma. That is, gossip could be a solution to first-order social dilemmas by introducing reputational benefits and costs to cooperation and defection. Yet, if sharing gossip is socially costly for gossipers while conferring collective benefits, people may refrain from gossip.","tags":[],"title":"The Costs and Benefits of Gossip","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1661935500,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1661935500,"objectID":"c6422698a682f3a6a6c140a1f9476e0b","permalink":"https://terencedorescruz.com/talk/cep_uq_talk/","publishdate":"2021-11-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/cep_uq_talk/","section":"talk","summary":"Gossip—a sender communicating to a receiver about an absent third party—is hypothesized to impact reputation formation, partner selection, and cooperation. Laboratory experiments have found that people gossip about others' cooperativeness and that they use gossip to condition their cooperation. Here, we move beyond the laboratory and test several predictions from theories of indirect reciprocity and reputation-based partner selection about the content of everyday gossip and how people use it to update the reputation of others in their social network. In a Dutch community sample (N = 309), we sampled daily events in which people either sent or received gossip about a target over 10 days (ngossip = 5284). Gossip senders frequently shared information about targets’ cooperativeness and did so in ways that minimize potential retaliation from targets. Receivers overwhelmingly believed gossip to be true and updated their evaluation of targets based on gossip. In turn, a positive shift in the evaluation of a target was associated with higher intentions to help them in future interactions, and with lower intentions to avoid them in the future.

In contrast, gossiping is commonly perceived negatively, implying that gossipers incur costs rather than benefits. To solve this puzzle, we argue that how receivers attribute gossip to pro-social versus pro-self motives shapes their reactions towards gossipers. To test this, we conducted a pre-registered experimental vignette study (n = 1188) in which participants received negative gossip statements, which we manipulated to reflect either pro-self or pro-social motives. Supporting our predictions, results showed that when receivers attributed negative gossip to pro-social (vs pro-self) motives, they trusted gossipers more, and targets less (for behavioral as well as attitudinal measures of trust). Furthermore, receivers were more likely to mistakenly attribute pro-social gossip to pro-self motives than vice versa, but those with a higher ability to overcome intuition were better able to correctly distinguish pro-self and pro-social motives for gossip.

To test this, we conducted a pre-registered experimental vignette study (n = 1188) in which participants received negative gossip statements, which we manipulated to reflect either pro-self or pro-social motives. Supporting our predictions, results showed that when receivers attributed negative gossip to pro-social (vs pro-self) motives, they trusted gossipers more, and targets less (for behavioral as well as attitudinal measures of trust). Furthermore, receivers were more likely to mistakenly attribute pro-social gossip to pro-self motives than vice versa, but those with a higher ability to overcome intuition were better able to correctly distinguish pro-self and pro-social motives for gossip.

To solve this puzzle, we argue that how receivers attribute gossip to pro-social versus pro-self motives shapes their reactions towards gossipers. To test this, we conducted a pre-registered experimental vignette study (n = 1188) in which participants received negative gossip statements, which we manipulated to reflect either pro-self or pro-social motives. Supporting our predictions, results showed that when receivers attributed negative gossip to pro-social (vs pro-self) motives, they trusted gossipers more, and targets less (for behavioral as well as attitudinal measures of trust). Furthermore, receivers were more likely to mistakenly attribute pro-social gossip to pro-self motives than vice versa, but those with a higher ability to overcome intuition were better able to correctly distinguish pro-self and pro-social motives for gossip.
